# How did the 2005 Greenpoint-Williamsburg Rezoning change the North Brooklyn neighborhoods?

These maps provide an easier way to understand the rezoning through bulk and use changes, dramatically changing the neighborhood by analyzing the change in zoning code. It also shows the effect on the zoning area through change in actualized FAR and property values on the block level using PLUTO data from 2004 and 2025. 

**This map is a work in progress.** Future data explorations on the map will show population and demographic level changes and specific call-outs to districts within the zoning as an ongoing personal project. I aim to write a companion piece to the map as well. 

This iteration was limited due to time constraints and challenges working with PLUTO data. I would love to hear your feedback and thoughts on where you think the map could be revised and edited.

Thank you for the great class!

Joseph
